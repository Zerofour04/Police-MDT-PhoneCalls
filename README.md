<h1 align="center"> üëÆPolice MDT</h1>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èInformation
- A police Mobile Data Terminal system designed for use on the FiveM platform and ESX framework.
- This resource provides police with an in-game Mobile Data Terminal integrated with [kashacters](https://github.com/2nd-Life/esx_kashacters) for the ESX framework.
- The system itself is self-explanatory to use, and provides compatibility for reports, mugshots, character notes, warrants, calls, plate searches and more.
- I tested it for a few months and it should work, unfortunately I don't play FiveM anymore, so I'm sharing some cool features with you.
- Honestly, I just forked this so I could share the GCPHONE Code with you.

## ‚≠êFeatures
- To access, set your character job to police and press `DEL` on your keyboard
- When stationary behind a vehicle, the MDT will automatically run plates when opened
- The command /mdt may also be used to access the UI
- Search, edit, delete and submit police reports & warrants
- Attach to, mark as waypoint, delete and edit calls
- Add character notes, mugshots and amend convictions
- Search for vehicles by license plate
- The MDT has functionality to present a different theme with another job, you just have to make the appropriate appendments yourself to do so. There‚Äôs a few functions in the [UI/script.js](ui/script.js) code to help with this.

    identifier = xPlayer.identifier
    addMessage(sourcePlayer, identifier, phoneNumber, message)
	
	local person = GetPlayerPed(_source)
	local coords = GetEntityCoords(person)
	local PlayerX = ESX.GetPlayerFromId(_source)
	local name = PlayerX.getName(_source)
